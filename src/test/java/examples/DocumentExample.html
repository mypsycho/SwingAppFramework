This is a very simple example of a SingleFrameApplication that
loads and saves a single text document.  Although it does not
possess all of the usual trappings of a single-document app, 
like versioning or support for undo/redo, it does serve
to highlight how to use actions, resources, and tasks.

<p>
The application's state is defined by two read-only bound properties:
<dl>
<dt><strong>File <code>file</code></strong></dt>
<dd>The current text File being edited.</dd>
<dt><strong>boolean <code>modified</code></strong></dt>
<dd>True if the current file needs to be saved.</dd>
</dl>
These properties are updated when the user interacts with the
application. They can be used as binding sources, to monitor
the application's state.
</p>
<p> 
The application is <code>launched</code> in the
main method on the "main" thread.  All the work of actually
constructing, <code>intializing</code>, and
<code>starting</code> the application actually
happens on the EDT.  
</p>
<p> 
The resources for this Application are defined in <code>
DocumentExample.properties</code>. 
</p>
<p> 
This application defines a small set of actions for opening
and saving files: <code>open</code>, <code>save</code>, 
and <code>saveAs</code>.  It inherits 
<code>cut/copy/paste/delete</code> ProxyActions from the
<code>Application</code> class.  The ProxyActions perform their
action not on the component they're bound to (menu items and
toolbar buttons), but on the component that currently 
has the keyboard focus.  Their enabled state tracks the
selection value of the component with the keyboard focus, 
as well as the contents of the system clipboard.
</p>
<p>
The action code that reads and writes files, runs asynchronously
on background threads.  The <code>open</code>, <code>save</code>, 
and <code>saveAs</code> actions all return a Task object which
encapsulates the work that will be done on a background thread.
The <code>showAboutBox</code> and 
<code>closeAboutBox</code> actions do their work
synchronously.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> this application is intended as a simple 
example, not as a robust text editor.  Read it, don't use it.
